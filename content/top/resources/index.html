<h3>R</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, for me, is the definitive guide to data science in R and can help you think about data problems. It is both highly approachable and will get you quite far along in your data needs and give you a robust beginner framework to think about data science problems. <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/">Advanced R</a> is as it says on the tin. If you really want to understand R as a programming language, this is the book for you (still making my way through it).</p></li>
<li><p>Package building<br />
<em>The</em> resource for building package in R is <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R Packages</a> by Hadley Wickham.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog creation<br />
I used hugo and blogdown to create this site. <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">The blogdown book</a> is the best place to start and <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/">this blog</a> is a nice intro</p></li>
<li><p>Text analysis<br />
<a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">Tidytext</a> for interpretable ways of gaining insight from text data. <a href="https://smltar.com/">Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R</a> seems like a follow on from the tidytext package, but for predictive modeling.</p></li>
