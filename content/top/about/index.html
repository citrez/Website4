<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, welcome to my blog!
I studies Maths an University and then went on to do a masters in Economics.
I’m now 25 and have been working or a couple of years as a data scientist in the city of London.
I love Hiking, Running, rowing and generally being outdoors.</p>

<h1>About my blog</h1>
<p>I started this blog as a project during the Covid pandemic, and really enjoyed the process of building and styling a website.
This is my first (<strong>very</strong>) tentative step into any form of website development,
so I hope this will only start to look better the more I learn about the underlying technologies.
I think there are loads of good reason to write a blog, improving communication, motivating yourself to learn new things and ‘giving back’ to the community, to name a few.</p>
<p>I think of this this website as somewhere between a blog and a personal notepad. I also maintain a <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/@ezracitron/spaces">gitbook</a> which i use as a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up">digital garden</a>, a place on the internet where I can leave my mark and others can come to explore my thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>I’ll be using this blog to write up about data science ideas that I feel are worth sharing.
Right now my main interests are in ML, text analysis, data-vis and R, so I’ll be focusing on
these 4 things for now, that will likely change with time, so stay tuned…</p>
