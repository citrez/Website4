## Intro

Managing your files usually boils down to 3 things.  

1. Creating them
2. Deleting them
3. Moving/Renaming them

No doubt, you've done all of these things many times with something like this
<br><br>
<img src = "finder.png" alt = "finder" width  = 400px>
<br><br>
That is great. It works very well for *99%* of cases. But, what happens when you have 3,000 files and you need to rename all of then, do you really want to click through each of them making changes individually? This is when a less graphical-user-interface reliant work-flow can really shine. I'll be setting up a dummy problem and showing you how to solve it with the neat `fs` package in R. For me, file manipulation is a tool I won't use everyday, but once in a while it'll make me feel like a magician and i'll be very happy I took the time to learn about it. 

```{r setup, echo =F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T, message = F,warning = F,cache = T )
```

## Using the fs Package

### Create a folder
We will set up a dummy folder that we'll delete at the end. So feel free to follow along without having to worry that you'll accidentally delete your the entire contents of your computer.


```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(fs)
dir_create('dummy_folder')
```

### Add some files

The beauty of the fs package is that the functions are vecotrised. Meaning, you pass in a vector and it applies the function on all the elements of the vector successively. This saves us the messy step of looping or passing to a map function. The path() function from fs, helps us stick file paths together. 

```{r , echo=T}
file_create(path = path('dummy_folder',paste0('test_',1:12) ), ext = 'txt' )
```

### Look at the contents for folders
Now we can explore what is it this folder using
```{r}
dir_ls('dummy_folder')
```

Or if we want that in a tidy tibble...

```{r}
dir_info('dummy_folder') %>% head(3) 
```

or if we want a tree of the structure...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = 'dummy_folder',recurse = 2)
```

### Combine using the pipe
Here's the cool part, we can pipe one function into another, so deleting everything in a folder is as simple and readable as this. dir_ls lists the content of the folder and file_delete is a vectorised function that deletes all files in the folder.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% file_delete()
```

What about changing file names? Also easy. (changing file names in equivalent to 'moving' them to a file with a different name)

```{r}
 file_move(path = dir_ls('dummy_folder'),
           new_path = dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% str_replace('test','train'))
```

Now lets delete this dummy folder

```{r}
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% file_delete()
```

### 'Real World' Use Case

In a real word use case, you may encounter something like this:
You have a messy folder with all types of files that have dates in the file name.
You want to organise them into a separate folders for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021.

This code sets up the messy folder
```{r}
create_dummy_file_names <- function(n = 3){
  years <- 2018:2021
  months <- stringr::str_pad(1:12,width = 2,side = 'left',pad = '0')
  days <- stringr::str_pad(1:31,width = 2,side = 'left',pad = '0')
  file_names <- paste(
    sample(years,replace = T,size  = n),
    sample(months,replace = T,size = n),
    sample(days,replace = T,size = n),
    sep = '-')
  
  file_names <- paste0('file_',file_names)
}


file_create(path = 
              path(
                'dummy_folder',
                create_dummy_file_names(200) ),
            ext = 'txt' )

```


Organising it is as easy as this
```{r}
dir_create(path('dummy_folder',2018:2021)) # create 2018-2021 folders

dir_info_dummy_folder <- dir_info('dummy_folder') %>% # get a df with file info
  select(path) %>%
  filter(fs::is_file(path)) %>% 
  mutate(year = str_extract(path,'\\d{4}'),
         new_path =path(fs::path_dir(path),year,fs::path_file(path)), # extract only the directory part of file path
         )

  
```

use our new_path column, to move our files from the old path name to the new path name. 
```{r}
file_move(dir_info_dummy_folder$path,dir_info_dummy_folder$new_path)
```

Done!
And all within the comfort of a tibble.

### Clean up

```{r}
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% file_delete()
dir_ls('dummy_folder') %>% dir_delete()
```
