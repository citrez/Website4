## How to start a blog

Let me be clear from the outset. **I am no webdeveloper**. I have however, thoroughly enjoyed the process of learning a little bit more about the techinques and technology that go into taking a website live, and I want to share some of the learnings in this post. I'll be linking to lots of resources that can explain all the detail.

### Use Blogdown to get up and running

Blogdown is a package in R which helps you build a static website, using Rmarkdown documents as the pages. A bit advantage of using Rmarkdown (.Rmd) over markdown (.md) files, is that it allows you to seemlessly include code in your blogs, very useful if you're writting for a technical audience. 

Alison hill, made a blog post using blogdown about how to make a blogpost using blogdown - meta. You can find it [here](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2017-06-up-running-with-blogdown/).

### Keep things tidy

One of the key consideration when blogging, and when building a website in general, is keeping this tidy and therefor maintainable. Since we are making a static site, conceptually, all this boils down to is writting content and then telling the comupter which content to retrieve when you click on certain things on the webpage. An organisational hurdle you will quickly run into, is how to make sure images, data and other things you want available in a given blogpost are stored in an accesable place for that blogpost, this can be simplified greatly using [page bundles](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2019-02-spoonful-bundles/) - again, alison hill to the rescue.
